# 🧠 Dynamic Programming in DAA

This section of the repository contains implementations of classic **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problems, frequently encountered in competitive programming, interviews, and algorithmic analysis.

## 📚 What is Dynamic Programming?

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable where the problem has **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.
